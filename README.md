# SlowList [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/simeg/SlowList.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/simeg/SlowList) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/simeg/slowlist/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/simeg/slowlist)

A simple List type that stores it's data within a String. Created for fun with
the assumption that it will be slower than a regular List in Python 3.

Benchmarks will follow!
